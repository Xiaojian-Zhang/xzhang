Hello, my name is Xiaojian Zhang, you can also call me Chase. 

I'm a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Civil and Costal Engineering](https://www.essie.ufl.edu/civil-coastal-engineering/) at the [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/), majoring in Transportation Engineering. My supervisor is [Prof. Xilei Zhao](https://www.essie.ufl.edu/people/name/xilei-zhao/), director of the [SERMOS Lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/sermos-lab/).

However, due to the pandemic and visa issues, I've been studying remotely in my home county China for almost one year. I'm currently working as a visiting research intern student in [New York Unversity Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/), under the guidence of [Prof. Zhibin Chen](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/zhibin-chen).
